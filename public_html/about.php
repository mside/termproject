				<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				<p>I first realized that I wanted to work in film and TV when I was 10 years old. I would spend the whole day watching animated movies, and I grew to love the genre. This love became a passion and when I was old enough I enrolled at Tecnológico de Monterrey in 2008 where I received a degree in Animation and Digital Art. It was there that I first learned about VFX and learned that I wanted to become a compositor for live action movies. I spent almost three years as a Motion Graphics Director before I decided to pursue VFX and enroll at Vancouver Institute of Media Arts. I like to think of myself as a complete film maker as I have a background in cinematography, production, direction, animation, as well as Visual Effects.
				When I was a kid, my first influence was The Mask. The special effects were amazing and Jim Carrey’s performance was amazing. Now that my tastes are more refined, I recognize Quentin Tarantino as a major influence on my work. In my opinion Reservoir Dogs is his greatest piece of work.

				<h3>Early Life and Hobbies</h3>
				<p>I was born and raised in Guadalajara Jalisco in Mexico in a soccer neighbourhood and consider my second greatest passion to be soccer. I still watch and play soccer regularly on the weekends. I also love photography and video games, I typically play soccer and adventure games in my spare time.

				<h3>Dreams and Aspirations</h3>
				<p>I aspire to one day become a Visual Effects Supervisor for a major production company and hopefully one day win an Oscar. Until then, I plan on applying for work as a Video Compositor as I consider it to be my greatest asset with Nuke being my software of choice. As a Video Compositor I love being able to merge every aspect of the film creation process together and creating a finished product.
